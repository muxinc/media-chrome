Media Chrome supports multiple languages for its UI components. By default, it uses English, but you can include additional languages by loading the corresponding language module.
## Available Languages
Currently, the supported languages are:

- **English** (default)
- **Spanish** (`es`)
- **French** (`fr`)
- **Portuguese** (`pt`)

## How to Include a Language

### Using HTML
To add support for a specific language in an HTML file, include the corresponding language module using a `<script>` tag:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/media-chrome@4/lang/pt.js"></script>
```

Replace `pt.js` with the appropriate language code (`es.js`, `fr.js`, etc.) for other languages.

> **Note:** This only works with the non-bundled version of Media Chrome (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/media-chrome@4`) and not the **`/+esm`** version. This is required because the `i18n.js` module must be imported separately to properly manage state.

### Using JavaScript
If you are working with JavaScript, you can import the language module as follows:

```js
import "media-chrome/lang/pt.js";
```

Again, replace `pt.js` with the desired language code.

## How Language Selection Works
Media Chrome automatically detects the user's preferred language based on their browser settings. If the corresponding language file has been imported, the UI will switch to that language.

If the user’s preferred language is not available, the UI will fall back to English.


## Adding a New Language
If you want to add support for a new language, you can create your own language file by extending an existing one, such as `es.js`. Here’s how:

1. Copy the contents of an existing language file (e.g., `es.js`).
2. Modify the translations to match your desired language.
3. Save it as a new file, e.g., `de.js` for German.
4. Import it into your project using:

   ```js
   import "./path-to-your-lang/de.js";
   ```

5. Ensure the browser can detect and apply the language based on user preferences.
