The `<media-play-button>` component is used to toggle your media playback state.  
In simpler terms, it is used to both play and pause your media content.

The contents and behavior of the `<media-play-button>` will update automatically 
once your media playback state changes.
  - When your media begins to play, the component will switch to show the contents of its `pause` slot.
  - When your media is paused, the component will display the contents of its `play` slot.

## Default usage

<SandpackContainer
  html={`<media-controller>
  <video
    slot="media"
    src="https://stream.mux.com/A3VXy02VoUinw01pwyomEO3bHnG4P32xzV7u1j1FSzjNg/low.mp4"
    playsinline
    muted
  ></video>
  <media-play-button></media-play-button>
</media-controller>`}
/>

## Customize icons

You can modify the contents of the `<media-play-button>` component using slots. 
This is useful if you'd like to use your own custom play button instead of 
the default one provided by media-chrome.

Here's an example of how you can replace the default play and pause icons with 
the literal words "Play" and "Pause":  

<SandpackContainer
  height={270}
  html={`<media-controller>
  <video
    slot="media"
    src="https://stream.mux.com/A3VXy02VoUinw01pwyomEO3bHnG4P32xzV7u1j1FSzjNg/low.mp4"
    playsinline
    muted
  ></video>
  <media-play-button>
    <span slot="play">Play</span>
    <span slot="pause">Pause</span>
  </media-play-button>
</media-controller>`}
/>


## Styling with attributes

The `<media-play-button>` does not expose any configuration attributes.  
However, it will be updated with **media state** attributes any time 
your media playback state changes.

You can use these attributes to apply custom styles to 
your `<media-play-button>` element under different state conditions:

```css
media-play-button[media-paused] {
  animation: glow 2s;
}
```
