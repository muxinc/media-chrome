The `<media-fullscreen-button>` component is used to toggle fullscreen viewing.

The contents and behavior of the `<media-fullscreen-button>` will update automatically based on the fullscreen state and availability.
- When the media is not fullscreen, the component will switch to display the contents of the `enter` slot.
- When the media is fullscreen, the component will switch to display the contents of the `exit` slot.

## Default usage

<ComponentSandpack
  client:load
  html={`<media-controller defaultsubtitles>
  <video
    playsinline muted crossorigin
    slot="media"
    src="https://stream.mux.com/A3VXy02VoUinw01pwyomEO3bHnG4P32xzV7u1j1FSzjNg/low.mp4"
  ></video>
  <media-fullscreen-button></media-fullscreen-button>
</media-controller>`}
/>

## Customize icons

You can modify the contents of the `<media-fullscreen-button>` component using slots.
This is useful if you'd like to use your own custom fullscreen button instead of the default one provided by media-chrome.

Here's an example of how you can replace the default fullscreen icons with the words "Enter" and "Exit"

<ComponentSandpack
  client:load
  height={250}
  html={`<media-controller defaultsubtitles>
  <video
    playsinline muted crossorigin
    slot="media"
    src="https://stream.mux.com/A3VXy02VoUinw01pwyomEO3bHnG4P32xzV7u1j1FSzjNg/low.mp4"
  ></video>
  <media-fullscreen-button>
    <span slot="enter">Enter</span>
    <span slot="exit">Exit</span>
  </media-fullscreen-button>
</media-controller>`}
/>

## Styling with attributes

The `<media-fullscreen-button>` doesn't expose any configuration attributes.
However, it will be updated with [Media UI Attributes](#media-ui-attributes) any time the fullscreen state and availability changes.

You can use these attributes to style the button. For example, hide the button if fullscreen is unavailable:

```css
media-fullscreen-button:not([mediafullscreenunavailable]) {
  display: none;
}
```
Or make the background blue if the media is fullscreen.
```css
media-fullscreen-button[mediaisfullscreen] {
  --media-control-background: blue;
}
```
